I graduated from Purdue University, West Lafayette in December 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. And now I'm just a random girl learning how to code 👩‍💻. I'm very much interested in making machines smart as human and hope that I can contribute to this thriving IT field very soon. I'm currently in the program called Boostcamp AI (Summer 2021) which is provided by Naver, one of the most famous tech companies in Korea. Can't wait to see yall again with more skills and proficiency! ✨
